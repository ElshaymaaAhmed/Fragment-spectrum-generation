# Fragment-spectrum-generation
Generating theoretical fragment spectra is central to many identification tasks in computational mass spectrometry. TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator can be configured to generate tandem MS spectra from a given peptide charge combination. There are various parameters which influence the generated ions e.g. simulating different fragmentation techniques.
